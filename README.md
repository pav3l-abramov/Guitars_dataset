# Dataset of guitars.
This dataset contains labeled pictures into 3 different classes (classical guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar). Some photos were marked in LabelImg, some were taken from another dataset, but without breaking them into 3 separate classes. The markup was made for the YOLO format.
