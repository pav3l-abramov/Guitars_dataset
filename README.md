# Dataset of guitars.
This dataset contains labeled pictures into 3 different classes (classical guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar). Some photos were marked in LabelImg, some were taken from another dataset (it was not divided into 3 separate classes). The markup was made for the YOLO format.
# The result of training the model on this dataset can be viewed in the MobileNNProject repository.
